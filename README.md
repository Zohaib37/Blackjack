The player should try to get as close to 21 as they can, without going over it.
If the player types 'y', another card from the deck is given to them and added to their score. If the score goes over 21. the final decks of both the player and the computer
are revealed and the computer wins. However, if the score is under 21, then the option to pick or stand is given again until the player types 'n' or goes over 21\
\
If the player types 'n', the final cards of the player and computer are revealed. If any one one of the two gets a score above 21, they lose. However, if both have a score
of less than 21, then the one with a higher score wins.\
Finally, at the end, the player is given the option to play again (press 'y') or quit (press 'n').\
